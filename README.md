# Solitaire
Implements the Solitaire Encryption Algorithm
This was a student assignment in Rutgers' CS 112 course in Spring 2015. This program encrypts a string using the solitaire
encryption algorithm, described at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_%28cipher%29
The program outline and driver were written by course instructors, while encryption methods in /src/solitaire.java were
written by Daniel Ayoub. These methods include jokerA, jokerB, tripleCut, countCut, getKey, encrypt and decrypt.
